# hephaestus-procedures
LaTeX source for HEPHAESTUS related procedures

To get the procedures, go to the [release page on right side](https://github.com/aris-space/helios-procedures/releases) and download it from the release assets.

## Usage

### Doing changes

Commit messages should follow [conventional commit message structure](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

**Exempt from this are commits that only change procedure contents.**

This means, if your commit edits anything other than procedure contents, then you should prefix your commit messages with for example
- `feat:` for changes that are not procedure related, e.g. adding a new LaTeX skeleton or
- `fix:` for all other changes
- `docs:` for documentation changes regarding the repo like updating the readme or comments in the LaTeX source.
- `refactor:` for changes in the LaTeX structure like renaming a file or moving imports

Changes should be small and atomic.
Basically make many small PRs rather than one big one.
PRs that make big changes can be made as drafts to better preview the planned adjustments but they should be merged as smaller individual changes.

⚠️ Note that the `main` branch is protected, all changes have to be made to new branches and then merged via a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) ⚠️

⚠️ You will **NOT** be able to push to `main` ⚠️

Whenenever there are unreleased changes on main, `tagpr` will create a new release pull request.
Merging that PR will automatically create a new release.

If you want to remove an entry in a procedure, make sure to comment it out in the source rather than deleting the line.
This makes it easier to see who "removed" an entry when using [`git blame`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame).
This is important as procedures often get entries removed that are assumed trivial or unnecessary.
As each team member has their own definition of what is "unnecessary", it is important to be able to easily see who removed an entry.

This only applies to procedure contents.
LaTeX commands etc can be deleted just fine if they are no longer needed.

### Structure

All LaTeX source is located in `src/` and from there separated by subteam (`dacs-sw`, ...).
The `src/common/` folder contains shared content like assets.

The `scripts` folder contains Python scripts used in generating the procedure PDFs.

### Other

By default, documents will have a draft watermark controlled by a single LaTeX variable unless they are compiled by the release pipeline.
