      device status = unhealthy, right button: factory reset IMPORTANT: If device shows as unhealthy, rather use the physical reset button on the KiDAQ (use needle to push button inside hole just next to status lights/power cable).
      This seems work more reliably than the software reset button.
      Also make sure the KiDAQ’s or KiDAQ PC’s IP address are not changed by a third-party program (like DHCP on a different PC).
      This will turn the device to unhealthy (connection doesn’t work anymore).
