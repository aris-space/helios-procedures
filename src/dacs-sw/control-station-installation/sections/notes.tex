  \noteItem{
    \textbf{Do not under any circumstances upgrade the Ubuntu version to a newer release} even if prompted!
    The ROS version we use is not compatible with all Ubuntu versions.
  }

  \noteItem{
    The \textbf{abort key for the UI is 'Esc'}.
    This will immediately trigger the abort sequence corresponding to the current phase.
  }

  \noteItem{
    To \textbf{stop a process} in the terminal: CTRL-C
  \\
    To \textbf{save a file}: CTRL-S
  }

  \noteItem{
    Important files that might have to be changed:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{/home/dacs/git/configuration-tests/PRO\_DACS-Configuration.xlsx}
            \\
            here you can change controllable actuators per phase and sensor abort thresholds, afterwards do catkin build again

      \item \textbf{/home/dacs/git/user-interface/rosWebPage/ui/configure\_ui.py}
            \\
            here you can change anything related to the UI, in particular which config file is used (this is quite unreadable code so use CTRL-F to find things)
            To apply changes run:
            Cd /home/dacs/git/user-interface/rosWebPage/ui/
            python3 configure\_ui.py

      \item \textbf{/home/dacs/git/software-rpi4/state\_machine/src/:}
            \\
            In this folder you find the state machine list (list of phases) and sequences (watch out for the syntax if you change anything here)
            Check which file is used in state\_machine.cpp
            afterwards do catkin build again

      \item \textbf{/home/dacs/git/software-rpi4/data\_acquisition/src/core/T7\_streaming.py}
            \\
            here you can change the streaming rate in case you get a Labjack buffer error or anything of that kind

      \item \textbf{/home/dacs/git/software-rpi4/data\_acquisition/launch/test.launch}
            \\
            here you can change which ROS modules are started at roslaunch, might be useful to delete the throttling module if it gives any errors for example

      \item \textbf{/home/dacs/git/software-rpi4/throttling\_control/src}
            \\
            In the setpoint.py, control.py and the core folder you can change the setting for the setpoints and the controller parameters.

    \end{itemize}
  }

  \noteItem{
    To see \textbf{error messages regarding the UI} in Firefox click on the three lines in the upper right corner, then 'More Tools' and 'Web Developer Tools'.
    Now you can see a few messages that might help find problems in the Configuration file for example
  }

  \noteItem{
    To \textbf{monitor ROS messages} run in terminal:
  \\
    cd catkin\_ws
  \\
    source ./devel/setup.bash
  \\
    then some useful commands are:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{rostopic list} (to see a list of topics)
      \item \texttt{rostopic echo /'topicname'} (the name of the actuator topics are: 'actuator\_\#actuatorid' and of sensor topics: 'sensor\_\#sensorid'
      \item \texttt{rostopic pub /throttling\_enabled dacs\_test/Control '{state: False}'}  (to publish)
      \item \texttt{rostopic hz /'topicname'} (to get frequency)
    \end{itemize}
  }

  \noteItem{
    For test without saving data:
  \\
    1.15 roslaunch data\_acquisition test\_minimum.launch
  }

  \noteItem{

    \textbf{Change measured quantity of mass flow sensor (Software part):}
  \\
    Open Config file in
  \\
    \texttt{/home/dacs/git/configuration-tests/PRO\_DACS-Configuration.xlsx}
  \\
    Open Sensors Sheet
  \\
    We need to change the row “oss\_mf” in the following way:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Change 'Sensor Designation' to the measured quantity, for example 'OSS mass flow'

      \item Change 'MIN\_SI' and 'MAX SI':
            for mass flow measurement 0 and 250,
            for density measurement 2 and 1150,
            for temperature measurement we need *min\_temp* and *max\_temp*
            (check with the person that configured the mass flow sensor wether these values are correct)

      \item Change 'Units [UI]' to g/s for mass flow, g/l for density, and °C for temperature
    \end{itemize}
  }
